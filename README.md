# Learn-ASL
LearnASL is an app for learning American Sign Language. It splits the learning process up into bite sized pieces, by teaching you *5 characters at a time.

*Not always 5 at a time, just usually.

## Disclaimer
I am not an ASL expert! If you are trying to learn ASL, you probably shouldn't use this app. I created this app as a way for me to practice my coding and ASL skills, I am not qualified to be teaching ASL. I made this app for myself, not to teach others.
If you find anything in the app that is wrong, wether it's a glitch or I mistakenly taught something incorrect, please open an issue on this Github repository.
