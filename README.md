# Disclaimer
I am not an ASL expert! If you are trying to learn ASL, you probably shouldn't use this app. I created this app as a way for me to practice my coding and ASL skills, I am NOT qualified to be teaching ASL. I made this app for myself, as a personal project, not really to teach others.
If you find anything in the app that is wrong, wether it's a glitch or I mistakenly taught something incorrect, feel free to open an issue on this Github repository if ya want.

# Learn-ASL
Learn-ASL is an app for learning fingerspelling in American Sign Language. It splits the learning process up into bite sized pieces, by teaching you *5 characters at a time.

*Not always 5 at a time, just usually.

## Features:
 - Teaches you how to fingerspell in ASL!
 - Has illustrations and descriptions to make it clear how it works.
 - Is split into 2 categories, letters and numbers!
 - It's written in python, and uses GTK... So that's cool I guess.

## Unfinished/Todos:
 - Overview tab still needs content.
 - Letters tab needs to be finished.
 - Numbers tab has barely been started, needs lots of work!
 - Maybe a button to switch between dark and light modes coming soon?
 - Add a welcome screen that shows up the first time you open the app.
