# Learn-ASL
LearnASL is an app for learning American Sign Language. It splits the learning process up into bite sized pieces, by teaching you *5 letters at a time.

* Not always 5 at a time, just usually.

## Disclaimer
I am not an ASL expert! I am just a person who has recently been learning ASL, and learning coding, and thought it would be fun to make an application that teaches ASL.
If you find anything in the app that is wrong, wether it's a glitch or I mistakenly taught something incorrect, please open an issue on this Github repository.
